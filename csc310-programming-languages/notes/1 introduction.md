## 1.1 The Art of Language Design

There are thousands of high-level programming languages, and new ones continue to emerge. Why?

1. **Evolution**: Find better ways to do something over time.

    - **GoTo-based** flow control: Basic, Fortran, Cobol, *evolved to*
    - **Repetition** (for, while, loops), **Selection** (if, else, switch, match), *evolved to*
    - **Nested block structure** (nested repetition and selection): Ada, Pascal, Algol, *evolved to*
    - **Object Orientated**: C++, Eiffel, Smalltalk

1. **Special Purpose**: Support a specific task or solve a specific problem.

    - **C** was developed to support creating a kernel and operating system development
    - **Java** was developed to support running the same program on "any device"
    - **Lisp** was developed for the implementation of A.I.
    - **Oracle** was developed for database.
    - **HTML** was developed for implementing a webpage.

1. **Personal Preference**: Every programming language has pros and cons, which are very subjective.

What makes a language successful?

1. **Expressive power**: Being able to express powerful concepts easily
    - c++: ++, --, +=, ...
    - visual basic: And <-> AndAlso, Or <-> OrElse

1. **Ease of Use**: People's view of how easy it is to program with.
1. **Ease of Implementation**: Unix C++ -> Visual C++
1. **Standardization**: If something is not standardized, then it causes massive headaches.
1. **Open Source**: Limiting access to something does not encourage people to use it.
    - ex. DoD for Ada, IBM Pl/I
1. **Excellent Compilers**
1. **Economic, Patronage, and Inertia**

It is a combinations of the above factors that may help determine whether a language is "good". We need to consider the *viewpoints* of both the *programmer* and the *language implementor*.
