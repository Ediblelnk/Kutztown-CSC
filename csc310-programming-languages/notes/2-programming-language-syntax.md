# 2. Programming Language Syntax

**Computer languages** must be *precise*. Both their **form** (syntax), and **meaning** (semantics) must be *specified without ambiguity*.

To provide the needed degree of *precision*, language designers and implementors *use formal syntactic and semantic notation*.

A **[context-free language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_language)** means that any part of the expression can be replaced with production rules, which don't change the meaning of the expression.

```unix
a -> cd
b -> eff
```

then

```unix
abba -> cdeffeffcd
```

**[Recursively Enumerable Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursively_enumerable_language)**
