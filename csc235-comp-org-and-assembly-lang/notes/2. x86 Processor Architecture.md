# 2. x86 Processor Architecture

This chapter focuses on the underlying hardware associated with x86 assembly language. It may be said that assembly language is the ideal software tool *for communicating directly with a machine*. A sample motherboard layout will give some insight into the hardware environment of x86 systems.

**Previous Chapter**: [[1. Basic Concepts]]

## 2.1 General Concepts

The x86 processor family includes all Intel IA-32 and Intel 64 processors, such as the Intel Pentium and Core-Duo, as well as AMD processors, such as Athlon, Phenom, Opteron, and AMD64.

### Basic Microcomputer Design

The ***central processor unit (CPU)***, where calculations and logical operations take place, contains a limited number of storage locations named **registers**, a high-frequency clock, a control unit, and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

![[img3.png]]

- The ***clock*** synchronizes the internal operations of CPU with other system components.
- The ***control unit*** (CU) coordinates the sequencing of steps involved in executing machine instructions.
- The ***arithmetic logic unit*** (ALU) performs arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction and logical operations such as *AND*, *OR*, and *NOT*.

The CPU is attached to the rest of the computer via pins attached to the CPU socket in the computer's motherboard. Most pins connect to the data bus, the control bus, and the address bus.

- The ***memory storage unit*** is where instructions and data are held while a computer program is running.
- The storage unit receives request for data from the CPU, transfers data from ***random access memory*** (RAM) to the CPU, and transfers data from the CPU into memory.
- A ***bus*** is a parallel transfer path that moves data from one part of the computer to another. A computer systems usually contains four bus types:
  - data
  - input/output (IO)
  - control
  - address
- The ***data bus*** transfers instructions and data between the CPU and memory.
- The ***IO bus*** transfers instructions and data between the CPU and the system I/O devices.
- The ***control bus*** uses binary signals to synchronize actions of all devices attached to the system bus.
- The ***address bus*** holds the addresses of instructions and data when the currently executing instruction transfers data between the CPU and memory.

### Clock

The basic unit of time for a machine instruction is a ***machine cycle*** (or ***clock cycle***).

![[img4.png | 400]]

A machine instruction requires at least one clock cycle to execute, and a few require in excess of 50 clocks. Instruction requiring memory access often have empty clock cycles called **wait cycle** because of the differences in the speeds of the CPU, the system bus, and memory circuits.

### Instruction Execution Cycle

The CPU has to go through a predefined sequence of steps to execute a machine instruction, called the ***instruction execution cycle***.

1. First, the CPU has to **fetch the instruction** from an area of memory called the *instruction queue*. Right after doing this, it increments the instruction pointer.
2. Next, the CPU **decodes** the instruction by looking at its binary bit pattern. The bit pattern might reveal that the instruction has operands (input values).
3. If operands are involved the CPU **fetches the operands** from registers and memory. Sometimes, this involves address calculations.
4. Next the CPU **executes** the instruction, using any operand values it fetched during the earlier step. It also updates a few status flags, such as Zero, Carry, and Overflow.
5. Finally, if an output operand was part of the instruction, the CPU **stores the result** of its execution in the operand.

We usually simplify this process to three basic steps: **Fetch**, **Decode**, and **Execute**.

In order to read program instructions from memory, an address is placed on the address bus. Next, the memory controller places the requested code on the data bus, making the code available inside the *code cache*. The instruction pointer's value determines which instruction will be executed next. The instruction is analyzed by the ***instruction decoder***, causing the appropriate digital signals to be sent to the control unit, which coordinates the ALU and floating-point unit.

![[img5.png]]

### Reading from Memory

Generally, computer read memory much slower than they access internal registers.

1. Place the address of the value you want to read on the address bus.
2. Assert (change the value of) the processor's RD (*read*) pin.
3. Wait one clock cycle for the memory chips to respond.
4. Copy the data from the data bus into the destination operand.

Each of these steps generally requires a single ***clock cycle***. 4 clock cycles go by fairly fast, but that's much slower than CPU registers, which are usually accessed in only one clock cycle.

#### How Cache Came About

CPU designers figured out a long time ago that computer memory creates a speed bottleneck because most programs have to access variables. They came up with a clever way to reduce the amount of time spent reading and writing memory: they store the most recently used instruction and data in high-speed memory called ***cache***. The idea is that a program is more likely to want to access the same memory and instructions repeatedly, so cache keeps these values where they can be accessed quickly. Also, when the CPU begins to execute a program, it can look ahead and load the next (for example) thousand instructions into cache, on the assumption that these instructions will be needed fairly soon. If there happens to be a loop in that block of code, the same instructions will be in cache. When the processor is able to find its data in cache memory, we call that a *cache hit*. On the other hand, it the CPU tries to find something in cache and it's not there, we call that a *cache miss*.

#### Cache Levels

***Level-1 cache***, also called *primary cache* is stored right on the CPU. ***Level-2 cache***, or *secondary cache*, is a little bit slower, and attached to the CPU by a high-speed data bus. The two types of cache work together in an optimal way.

There's a reason why cache memory is faster than conventional RAM: it's because cache memory is constructed from a special type of memory chip called ***static RAM***. It's expensive, but it does not have to be constantly refreshed in order to keep its contents. On the other hand, conventional memory, known as ***dynamic RAM***, must be refreshed constantly. It's much slower, but cheaper.

### Loading and Executing a Program

Before a program can run, it must be loaded into memory by a ***program loader***. After loading, the operating system must point the CPU to the ***program's entry point***. which is the address at which the program is to begin execution.

- The **operating system** (OS) searches for a program's filename in the current disk directory. If it cannot find the name there, it searches a predetermined list of directories, called *paths*, for the filename. If the OS fails to find the program filename, it issues an error message.
- The OS determines the next available location in memory and loads the program file into memory. It allocates a block of memory to the program and enters information about the program's size and location into a table (sometimes called a descriptor table).
- The OS begins execution of the program's first machine instruction (its entry point). As soon as the program begins running, it is called a **process**. The OS assigns the process an identification number (***process ID***), which is used to keep track of it while running.
- The process runs by itself. It is the OS's job to track the execution of the process and to respond to requests for system resources. Examples of resources are memory, disk files, and I/O devices.
- When the process ends, it is removed from memory.

## 2.2 32-Bit x86 Processors

In this section, we focus on the basic architectural features of all x86 processors.

### Modes of Operation

x86 Processors have three primary modes of operation: protected mode, real-address mode, and system management mode. A sub-mode, ***virtual-8086***, is a special case of protected mode.

######## Protected Mode

This is the native state of the processor, in which all instructions and features are available. Programs are given separate memory areas named ***segments***, and the processor prevents programs from referencing memory outside their assigned segments.

######## Virtual-8086 Mode

While in protected mode, the processor can safely execute real-address mode software such as MS-DOS programs in a sandbox-like environment named ***virtual-8086 mode***. If a program crashes or attempts to write data into the system memory area, it will not affect other programs running at the same time. A modern operating system can execute multiple separate virtual-8086 session at the same time.

######## Real-Address Mode

Real-address mode implements the programming environment of an early Intel processor with a few extra features, such as the ability to switch into other modes. This mode is useful if a program requires direct access to system memory and hardware devices. Current versions of the Windows operating systems do not support Real-Address mode.

######## System Management Mode

System management mode (SMM) provides its host operating system with a mechanism for implementing functions such as power management and system security. These functions are usually implemented by computer manufacturers who customize the processor for a particular system setup.

### Basic Execution Environment

#### Address Space

In a 32-bit processor running in protected mode, a tasks or program can address linear address space of up to 4 GB. A technique called ***extended physical addressing*** allows a total of 64 GB of physical memory to be addressed. Real-address mode programs, on the other hand, can only address a range of 1 MB. If the processor is in protected mode and running multiple program in virtual 8086 mode, each program has its own 1 MB memory area.

#### Basic Program Execution Registers

A ***register*** is a high-speed storage location directly inside the CPU, designed to be access at a much higher speed than conventional memory. When a processing loop is optimized for speed, for example, loop counters are held in registers rather than variables. There are eight general purpose registers, six segment registers, a processor status flags register (EFLAGS), and an instruction pointer (EIP).

![[img6.png]]

#### General-Purpose Registers

The ***general-purpose registers*** are primarily used for arithmetic and data movement. The lower 16 bits of the EAX register can be reference by the name AX.

![[img7.png]]

Portions of some registers can be addressed as 8-bit values.

| 32-Bit | 16-Bit | 8-Bit (High) | 8-bit (Low) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| EAX | AX | AH | AL |
| EBX | BX | BH | BL |
| ECX | CX | CH | CL |
| EDX | DX | DH | DL |

The remaining general-purpose registers can only be accessed using 32-bit or 16-bit names:

| 32-Bit | 16-bit |
| :-: | :-: |
| ESI | SI |
| EDI | DI |
| EBP | BP |
| ESP | SP |

#### Specialized Uses

- EAX is automatically used by multiplication and division instructions. It is often called the *extended accumulator* register.
- The CPU automatically uses ECX as a loop counter.
- ESP addresses data on the stack. It is rarely used for ordinary arithmetic or data transfer. It is often called the *extended stack pointer* register.
- ESI and EDI are used by high-speed memory transfer instructions. They are sometimes called the *extended source index* and *extended destination index* registers.
- EBP is used by high-level languages to reference function parameters and local variables on the stack. It should *not* be used for ordinary arithmetic or data transfer expect at an advanced level of programming. It is often called the *extended frame pointer* register.

##### Segment Registers

In x86 protected mode, ***segment registers*** hold pointer to segment descriptor tables. Some segments hold program instructions (code),  others hold variables (data), and another segment named the *stack segment* holds local function variables and function parameters.

##### Instruction Pointer

The EIP, or **instruction pointer**, register contains the address of the next instruction to be executed. Certain machine instructions manipulate EIP, causing the program to branch to a new location.

##### Status Flags

- **Carry flag** (CF) is set when the result of an *unsigned* arithmetic operation is too large to fit into the destination
- **Overflow flag** (OF) is set when the result of a *signed* arithmetic operation is too large or too small to fit into the destination.
- **Sign flag** (SF) is set when an arithmetic or logical operation generates a negative result.
- **Zero flag** (ZF) is set when an arithmetic or logical operation generates a result of zero.
- **Auxiliary Carry flag** (AC) is set when an arithmetic operation causes a carry from bit 3 to bit 4 in an 8-bit operand.
- **Parity flag** (PF) is set if the least-significant byte in the result contains an even number of 1 bits. Otherwise, PF is clear. In general, it is used for error checking when there is a possibility that data might be altered or corrupted.

##### Floating-Point Unit

The ***floating-point unit*** (FPU) performs high-speed floating point arithmetic. The FPU is integrated into the main processor chip. There are eight floating-point data registers in the FPU, named ST(0), ST(1), and so on.

## 2.3 64-Bit x86-64 Processors

This section focuses on the basic architectural details of all 64-bit processors that use the x86-64 instruction set.

1. It is backward-compatible with the x86 instruction set.
2. Addresses are 64 bits long, allowing for a virtual address space of 2^64 bytes, or 16,384 Petabytes of address space. *In current chip implementations, only the lowest 48 bits are used*.
3. It can use 64-bit general purpose registers, allowing instruction to have 64-bit integer operands.
4. It uses eight more general-purpose registers than the x86.
5. It uses a 48-bit physical address space, which supports up to 256 terabytes of RAM.

### Operation Modes

The Intel 64 architecture introduced a new mode named *IA-32e*. Technically it contains two sub modes, named *compatibility mode* and *64-bit mode*. But it's easier to refer to these as modes rather than sub modes.

#### Compatibility Mode

When running in ***compatibility mode***, also known as *32-bit mode*, existing 16-bit and 32-bit applications can usually run without being recompiled.

#### 64-Bit Mode

In ***64-bit mode***, the processor runs applications that use the 64-bit linear address space. This is the native mode for 64-bit Microsoft windows. This mode enables 64-bit instructions operands.

### Basic 64-bit Execution Environment

In 64-bit mode, addresses can theoretically be as large as 64-bits, although processors currently only support 48 bits for addresses.

- Sixteen 64-bit general purpose registers (*in 32-bit mode, you have only eight general-purpose registers*)
- Eight 80-bit floating-point registers
- A 64-bit status flags register named RFLAGS (only the lower 32 bits are used).
- A 64-bit instruction pointer named RIP

#### General Purpose Registers

| Operand Size | Available Registers |
| --: | :-- |
| 8 bits | AL, BL, CL, DL, DIL, SIL, BPL, SPL, R8L, R10L, R11L, R12L, R13L, R14L, R15L |
| 16 bits | AX, BX, CX, DX, DI, SI, BP, SP, R8W, R9W, R10W, R12W, R13W, R15W |
| 32 bits | EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EDI, ESI, EBP, ESP, R8D, R9D, R10D, R11D, R12D, R13D, R14D, R15D |
| 64 bits | RAX, RBX, RDX, RSI, RBP, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15 |

Here are a few more details to remember:

- The 32-bit EFLAGS register is replaced by a 64-bit RFLAGS register in 64-bit mode. The two registers share the same lower 32 bits, and the upper 32 bits of RFLAGS are not used.
- The status flags are the same in 32-bit mode and 64-bit mode.

## 2.4 Components of a Typical x86 Computer

### Motherboard

A microcomputer's ***motherboard*** is a flat circuit board onto which are placed the computer's CPU, supporting processors (*chipset*), main memory, I/O connectors, power supply connectors, and expansion slots. These components are connected to each other by a ***bus***, a set of wares etched directly on the motherboard.

- CPU socket
- Memory slots (SIMM or DIMM)
- BIOS (basic-input-output system) computer chips
- CMOS RAM, with a small circular battery to keep it powered
- Connectors for mass-storage devices such as hard drives and CD-ROMs
- USB connectors for external devices
- Keyboard and mouse ports
- PCI bus connectors for sound cards, graphics cards, data acquisition boards, and other I/O devices

Following are some important support processors in a typical legacy system:

- The ***Floating-Point Unit*** (FPU) handles floating-point and extended integer calculations.
- The 8284/82C284 *Clock Generator*, known simply as the ***clock***, oscillates at a constant speed. The clock generator synchronizes the CPU and the rest of the computer.
- The 8259A ***Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)*** interface handles external interrupts from hardware devices, such as the keyboard, system clock, and disk drives. These devices interrupt the CPU and make it process their requests immediately.
- The 8253 ***Programmable Interval Timer/Counter*** interrupts the system 18.2 times per second, updates the system date and clock, and controls the speaker. It is also responsible for constantly refreshing memory because RAM memory chips can remember their data for only a few milliseconds.
- The ***Universal Serial Bus (USB) controller*** transfers data to and from devices connected to USB ports.

### Memory

Several basic types of memory have been used in Intel-based systems for many years: ***read-only memory (ROM)***, erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), ***static RAM*** (SRAM), video RAM (VRAM), and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) RAM:

- **ROM** is permanently burned into a chip and cannot be erased.
- **EPROM** can be erased slowly with ultraviolet light and reprogrammed.
- **DRAM**, commonly known as main memory, is where programs and data are kept when a program is running. It is inexpensive, but must be refreshed every millisecond to avoid losing its contents. Some systems use ECC (error checking and correcting) memory.
- **SRAM** is used primarily for expensive, high-speed cache memory. It does not have to be refreshed. CPU cache memory uses SRAM.
- **VRAM** holds video data. It is dual ported, allowing one port to continuously refresh the display while another port writes data to the display.
- **CMOS RAM** on the system motherboard stores system setup information. It is refreshed by a battery, so it contents are retained when the computer's power is off.

## 2.5 Input-Output System

### Levels of I/O Access

- **High-level language functions**: a high-level programming language such as C++ or Java contains functions to perform I/O. They work on a variety of different computer systems and are not dependent on any one operating system.
- **Operating system**: programming can call operating system functions from a library known as the operating system API (*application programming interface*). The operating system provides high-level operations such as writing strings to files, reading strings from the keyboard, and allocating blocks of memory.
- **BIOS**: the *basic-input-output system* is a collection of low-level subroutines that communicate directly with hardware devices. The BIOS is installed by the computer's manufacturer and is tailors to fit the computer's hardware. Operating systems typically communicate with the BIOS.

#### Device Drivers

***Device drivers*** are programs that permit the operating system to communicate directly with hardware devices and the system BIOS. Often, after a device has been attached and identified, the OS recognizes the device name and signature; it then locates and installs the device driver software onto the computer.

Here are the steps that happen when an application program displays a string of characters on the screen:

1. A statement in the application program calls an HLL library function that writes the string to standard output.
2. The library function calls an operating system function, passing a string pointer.
3. The operating system function uses a loop to call a BIOS subroutine, passing it the ASCII code and color of each character. The operating system calls another BIOS subroutine to advance the cursor to the next position on the screen.
4. The BIOS subroutine receives a character, maps it to a particular system font, and sends the character to a hardware port attached to the video controller card.
5. The video controller card generates timed hardware signals to the video display that control the raster scanning and displaying of pixels.

![[img9.png]]

#### Programming at Multiple Levels

Assembly language programs have power and flexibility in the area of input-output programming.

![[img10.png]]

General-purpose operating systems rarely permit application programs to directly access system hardware, because to do so would make it nearly impossible for multiple programs to run simultaneously. Instead, hardware is accessed only by device drivers, in a carefully controlled manner. On the other hand, smaller operating systems for specialized devices often connect directly to hardware. They do this in order to reduce the amount of memory taken up by operating system code, and they almost always run only on one program at a time.
