After a long and hard debugging session with Rust, I decided it was in my best interest to pivot to Python,
much to my dismay. I really want to get this working in Rust, but I keep running into issues with deadlocks.

Regardless, I am already pretty familiar with Python, so I was able to finish the program with little trouble.

Again, thank you for the extension, I will be much more careful from now on about starting early.
