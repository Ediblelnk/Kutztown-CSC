This chapter focuses on the basic building blocks of Microsoft assembly language. It covers how constants and variables are defined, standard formats for numeric and string literals, and how to assemble and run your first programs.

# 3.1 Basic Language Elements

Assembly language programming might have a reputation for being obscure and tricky, but rather, it is a language that gives you nearly total information. You get to see everything that is going on, even in the CPU's registers and flags.

## First Assembly Language Program

Here is a simple assembly program that adds two numbers and saves the result:

	.data        ; this is data area
	sum DWORD 0  ; create a variable named sum
	
	.code        ; this is the code area
	main PROC
		mov eax, 5    ; move 5 to eax
		add eax, 6    ; add 6 to the eax register
		mov sum, eax  ; put eax into sum variable in memory
		
		INVOKE ExitProcess,0    ; end the program
	main ENP

The areas marked by the `.code` and `.data` directives, are called ***segments***. A segment is a designated storage area that holds either program code, program variables, or the stack.

## Integer Literals

An ***integer literal*** is made up of an optional leading sign, one or more digits, and an optional radix character that indicates the number's base:

	[{+ | -}] digits [ radix ]

\*elements within square brackets `[..]` are optional and elements within braces `{..}` require a choice of one of the enclosed elements, separated by the `|` character. Elements in *italics* identify items that have known definitions or descriptions.

Here are possible radix values:

| Value | Meaning | Value | Meaning |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `h` | hexadecimal | `r` | encoded real |
| `q/o` | octal | `t` | decimal (alternative) |
| `d` | decimal | `y` | binary (alternative) |
| `b` | binary |

## Constant Integer Expressions

A ***constant integer expression*** is a mathematical expression involving integer literals and arithmetic operations. The important thing to realize about constant integer expressions is that *they can only be evaluated at assembly time*.

| Operator | Name | Precedence Level |
| :-: | :-- | :-: |
| `()` | Parentheses | 1 (highest) |
| `+,-` | Unary plus, minus | 2 |
| `*,/` | Multiple, divide | 3 |
| `MOD` | Modulus | 3 |
| `+,-` | Add, subtract | 4 (lowest) |

Examples of valid expressions and their values:

| Expression | Value |
| :-: | --: |
| `16 / 5` | `3` |
| `-(3+4) * (6-1)` | `-35` |
| `-3+4 * 6-1` | `20` |
| `25 MOD 3` | `1` |

## Real Number Literals

***Real number literals***, also called ***floating-point literals*** are represented as either decimal reals or encoded (hexadecimal) reals. A ***decimal real*** contains an optional sign followed by an integer, a decimal point, an optional integer that expresses a fraction, and an optional exponent:

	[{+,-}]integer.[integer][E{+,-}integer]

Some valid examples of decimal reals: `2.`, `+3.0`, `-44.2E+05`, `26.E5`. At least one digit and a decimal point are required. An ***encoded real*** represents a real number in hexadecimal, using the IEEE floating-point format for short reals. For example, the binary representation of decimal `+1.0` is

	0011 1111 1000 000 000 000 000 000

as a short real in assembly language

	3F800000r

## Character Literals

A ***character literal*** is a single character enclosed in single or double quotes. The assembler stores the value in memory as the character's binary ASCII code. Examples are

	'A'    "d"

## String Literals

A ***string literal*** is a sequence of characters (including spaces) enclosed in single or double quotes:

	'ABC'   'X'   "Good night, Gracie"   '4096'

Embedded quotes are permitted when used in the manner shown by the following examples

	"This isn't a test"      'Say "Good night," Gracie'

## Reserved Words

A ***reserved word*** is a word in a source code program that has a special meaning determined by the assembly language's syntax. It can only be used in the correct context.

| Type | Example Reserved Words |
| :-- | :-: |
| Instruction mnemonics | `MOV`, `ADD`, and `MUL` |
| Register names | `EAX` and `BX` |
| Directives | `INVOKE` or `ENDP` |
| Attributes | `BYTE` and `WORD` |
| Operators | `*` or `+` |
| Predefined symbols |

## Identifiers

An ***identifier*** is a programmer-chosen name. It might identify a variable, a constant, a procedure, or a code label. There are few rules on how identifiers can be form:

- They may contain between 1 and 247 characters.
- The are **not** case sensitive.
- The first character must be a letter (A..Z, a..z), underscore (\_), @, ?, or $. Subsequent characters may also be digits.
- An identifier cannot be the same as an assembler reserved word.

Generally, you should avoid the @ symbol and underscore as leading characters, since they are used both by the assembler and by high-level language compilers.

## Directives

A ***directive*** is a command embedded in the source code that is recognized and acted upon by the assembler. Directives do not execute at runtime, but they let you define variables, macros, and procedures. Directives are, by default, not case sensitive, meaning `.data`, `.DATA`, and `.Data` are equivalent.

Although all assemblers for Intel processors share the same instruction set, they usually have different sets of directives. The Microsoft assembler's `REPT` directive is not recognized by some other assemblers.

### Defining Program Statements

One important function of assembler directives is to define program segments. For example, one segment can be used to define variables, and is identified by the `.data` directive. The `.code` directive identifies the area of a program containing executable instructions. The `.stack` directive identifies the area of a program holding the runtime stack, setting its size, for example `.stack 100h`.

## Instructions

An ***instruction*** is a statement that becomes executable when a program is assembled. Instructions are translated by the assembler into machine language bytes, which are loaded and executed by the CPU at runtime. An instruction contains four basic parts.

	[label:] mnemonic [operands] [;comment]

### Label

A ***data label*** identifies the location of a variable, providing a convenient way to reference the variable in code. The following, for example, defines a variable named count:

	count DWORD 100

The assembler assigns a numeric address to each label. It is possible to define multiple data items following a label. Here, array defines the location of the first number `1024`. The other numbers following in memory immediately afterward:

	array DWORD 1024, 2048
	DWORD 4049, 8192

A label in the code area of a program must end with a colon `:` character. ***Code labels*** are used as targets of jumping and looping instructions.

A code label can share the same line with an instruction, or it can be on a line by itself:

	L1: mov ax, bx
	L2:

### Instruction Mnemonic

An ***instruction mnemonic*** is a short word that identifies an instruction.

| Mnemonic | Description |
| :-: | :-- |
| `mov` | Move (assign) one value to another |
| `add` | Add two values |
| `sub` | Subtract one value from another |
| `mul` | Multiply two values |
| `jmp` | Jump to a new location |
| `call` | Call a procedure |

### Operands

An ***operand*** is a value that is used for input or output for an instruction.

| Example | Operand Type |
| :-: | :-: |
| `96` | Integer literal |
| `2+4` | Integer expression |
| `eax` | Register |
| `count` | Memory |

Some operators, such as `stc`, which sets the carry flag, has no operands. The `inc` instruction has one operand. The `mov` instruction has two operands. In general, when instructions have multiple operands, the first is the *destination*, and any following operand will be a *source*.

The `imul` instruction has three operands, in which the first operand is the destination, and the following two operands are source operands

	imul eax, ebx, 5

In this case, `EBX` is multiplied by 5, and the product is stored in the `EAX` register.

### Comments

- Single-line comments begin with a semicolon `:`. All characters following the semicolon on the same line are ignored by the assembler.
- Block comments, beginning with the `COMMENT` directive and a user-specified symbol.

Here is an example:

	COMMENT !
		This line is a comment.
		This line is also a comment.
	!

We can also use any other symbol, as long as it does not appear within the comment lines.

	COMMENT &
		This line is a comment.
		This line is also a comment.
	&

### The NOP (No Operation) Instruction

The `NOP` instruction takes 1 byte of program storage and doesn't do any work. It is sometimes used by compilers and assemblers to align code to efficient address boundaries.

	00000000 66 8B C3    mov ax,bx
	00000003 90          nop       ; align next instruction
	00000004 8B D1       mov edx,exc

x86 processors are design to load code and data more quickly from even doubleword addresses.

# 3.2 Example: Adding and Subtracting Integers

## The *AddTwo* Program

	.386
	.model flat, stdcall
	.stack 4096
	ExitProcess PROTO, dwExitCode: DWORD
	
	.code
	main PROC
		mov eax, 5    ; move 5 to the eax register
		add eax, 6    ; add 6 to the eax register
		
		INVOKE ExitProcess, 0
	main ENDP
	END main

- Line 4 contains the `.386` directive, which identifies this as a 32-bit program that can access 32-bit registers and addresses.
- Line 5 selects the program's memory model (*flat*), and identifies the calling convention (named *stdcall*) for procedures.
- Line 6 sets aside 4096 bytes of storage for the runtime stack, which every program must have.

### Use Comments

It's a very good idea to include a program description, the name of the program's author, creation date, and information about subsequent modifications. Documentation of this kind is useful to anyone who reads the program listing (including you, months or years from now).

# 3.3 Assembling, Linking, and Running Programs

A source program written in assembly language cannot be executed directly on its target computer. It must be translated, or *assembled* into executable code. In fact, an assembler is very similar to a ***compiler***.

The ***assembler*** produces a file containing machine language called an ***object file***. The file isn't quite ready to execute. It must be passed to another program called a ***linker***, which in turn produces an ***executable file***. This file is ready to execute from the operating system's command prompt.

## The Assemble-Link-Execute Cycle

1. A programmer uses a **text editor** to create an ASCII text file named the ***source file***.
2. The **assembler** reads the source file and produces an ***object file***. Optionally, it produces a ***listing file***. If any errors occur, the programmer must return to step 1 and fix the program.
3. The ***linker*** reads the object file and checks to see if the program contains any calls to procedures in a ***link library***. The **linker** copies any required procedures from the link library, combines them with the object file, and produces the ***executable file***.
4. The operating system **loader** utility reads the executable file into memory and branches the CPU to the program's starting address, and the program begins to execute.

![[img11.png]]

## Listing File

A ***listing file*** contains a copy of the program's source code, with line numbers, the numeric address of each instruction, the machine code bytes of each instruction (in hexadecimal), and a program table.

The symbol table contains the names of all program identifiers, segments, and related information. Advanced programmers sometimes use the listing file to get detailed information about the program.

# 3.4 Defining Data

## Intrinsic Data Types

The assembler recognizes a basic set of ***intrinsic data types***, which describe types in terms of their size (byte, word, doubleword, and so on), whether they are signed, and whether they are integers or reals.

## Data Definition Statement

A ***data definition statement*** sets aside storage in memory for a variable, with an optional name.

	[name] directive initializer [,initializer] ...

| Type | Usage |
| --: | :-- |
| `BYTE` | 8-bit unsigned integer. `B` stands for byte |
| `SBYTE` | 8-bit signed integer. `S` stands for signed |
| `WORD` | 16-bit unsigned integer |
| `SWORD` | 16-bit signed integer |
| `DWORD` | 32-bit unsigned integer. `D` stands for double |
| `SDWORD` | 32-bit signed integer. `SD` stands for signed double |
| `FWORD` | 48-bit integer (Far pointer in protected mode) |
| `QWORD` | 64-bit integer. `Q` stands for quad |
| `TBYTE` | 80-bit integer. `T` stands for Ten-byte |
| `REAL4` | 32-bit IEEE short real |
| `REAL8` | 64-bit IEEE long real |
| `REAL10` | 80-bit IEEE extended real |

Example of a data definition statement:

	count DWORD 12345

The optional name assigned to a variable must conform to the rules for identifiers.

### Directive

The directive in a data definition statement can by `BYTE`, `WORD`, `DWORD`, `SBYTE`, `SWORD`, or any of the types listed in the table above. There are also legacy data definition directives:

| Directive | Usage |
| --: | :-- |
| `DB` | 8-bit integer |
| `DW` | 16-bit integer |
| `DD` | 32-bit integer or real |
| `DQ` | 64-bit integer or real |
| `DT` | 80-bit integer |

### Initializer

At least one ***initializer*** is required in a data definition, even if it is zero. For integer data types, ***initializer*** is an integer literal or integer expression matching the size of the variable's type, such as `BYTE` or `WORD`. To leave a variable uninitialized, the `?` symbol can be used as the initializer.

## Defining `BYTE` and `SBYTE` Data

	value1 BYTE 'A'     ; characte literal
	value2 BYTE 0       ; smallest unsigned byte
	value3 BYTE 255     ; largest unsigned byte
	
	value4 SBYTE -128   ; smallest signed byte
	value5 SBYTE +127   ; largest signed byte
	
	value6 BYTE ?       ; uninitialized BYTE

### Multiple Initializers

If multiple initializers are used in the same data definition, its label refers only to the offset of the *first* initializer. In the example, assume `list` is located at offset `0000`. If so, the value `10` is at offset `0000`, `20` is at offset `0001`, `30` is at offset `0002`, and `40` is at offset `0003`:

	list BYTE 10,20,30,40

Within a single data definition, its initializer can use different radixes. Character and string literals can be freely mixed. In the example, `list1` and `list2` have the same contents:

	list1 BYTE 10,32,41h,00100010b
	list2 BYTE 0Ah,20h,'A',22h

### Defining Strings

The most common type of strings ends with a null byte (containing 0). Called a *null-terminated* string, strings of this type are used in many programming languages:

	greeting1 BYTE "Good afternoon",0
	greeting2 BYTE 'Good night',0

A string can be divided between multiple lines without having to supply a label for each line:

	greeting BYTE "Welcome to the Encryption Demo Program "
	                 BYTE "created by Kip Irvine.",0dh,0ah
	                 BYTE "If you wish to modify this program, please"
	                 BYTE "send me a copy.",0dh,0ah,0

The hexadecimal codes `0Dh` and `0Ah` are alternately called CD/LF, carriage-return line-feed, or ***end-of-line characters***. When written to standard output, they move the cursor to the left column of the line following the current line.

The line continuation character `\` concatenates two source code lines into a single statement. It must be the last character on the line. 

	greeting1 \
	BYTE "Welcome to the Encryption Demo Program "

### DUP Operator

The `DUP` operator allocates storage for multiple data items, using an integer expression as a counter. It is useful for allocating space for a string or array, and can be used with initialized or uninitialized data:

	BYTE 20 DUP(0)          ; 20 bytes, all equal to zero
	BYTE 20 DUP(?)          ; 20 bytes, uninitialized
	BYTE  4 DUP("STACK")    ; 20 bytes: "STACKSTACKSTACKSTACK"

## Defining Packed BCD (TBYTE) Data

Intel stores a ***packed binary coded decimal*** (BCD) integer in a 10-byte package. Each byte (expect the highest) contains two decimal digits. In the lower 9 bytes, each half-byte holds a single decimal digit. In the highest byte, the highest bit indicates the number's sign. If the highest byte equals 80h, the number if negative; if the highest byte equals 00h, the number if positive. BCD are stored in little-endian order, with the low-order byte at the variable's starting offset

| Decimal Value | Storage Bytes |
| --: | :-: |
| +1234 | `34 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` |
| -1234 | `32 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80` |

## Defining Floating-Point Types

`REAL4` defines a 4-byte single precision floating-point variable. `REAL8` defines an 8-byte double-precision value, and `REAL10` defines a 10-byte extended-precision value. Each requires one or more real constant initializers:

	rVal1      REAL4  -1.2
	rVal2      REAL8   3.2E-260
	rVal3      REAL10  4.6E+4096
	ShortArray REAL4   20 DUP(0.0)

| Data Type | Significant Digits | Approx. Low Range | Approx. High Range |
| --: | :-: | --: | --: |
| Short real | 6 | 1.18x10^(-38) | 3.40x10^(38) |
| Long real | 15 | 2.23x10^(-308) | 1.79x10^(308) |
| Extended precision real | 19 | 3.37x10^(-4932) | 1.18x10^(4092) |

## Little Endian Order

x86 processors store and retrieve data from memory using ***little-endian order*** (low to high). The least significant byte is stored at the first memory address allocated for the data. The remaining bytes are stored in the next consecutive memory position. Consider the double word 12345678h. It would be stored at such:

| Address | Data |
| :-: | :-: |
| `0000` | `78` |
| `0001` | `56` |
| `0002` | `34` |
| `0003` | `12` |

Some other computer systems use ***big-endian order*** (high to low). Considering the same double word 12345678h, this is how it would be stored in big-endian order:

| Address | Data |
| :-: | :-: |
| `0000` | `12` |
| `0001` | `34` |
| `0002` | `56` |
| `0003` | `78` |

## Declaring Uninitialized Data

The `.data?` directive declares uninitialized data. When defining a large block of uninitialized data, the `.data?` directive *reduces the size of a compiled program*.

For example, the following code is declared efficiently:

	.data
	smallArray DWORD 10 DUP(0)      ; 40 bytes
	.data?
	bigArray   DWORD 5000 DUP (?)   ; 20,000 bytes, not initialized

The following code, on the other hand, produces a compiled program 20,000 bytes larger:

	.data
	smallArray DWORD 10 DUP(0)      ; 40 bytes
	bigArray   DWORD 5000 DUP(?)    ; 20,000 bytes

### Mixing Code and Data

The assembler lets you switch back and forth between code and data in you programs. For example:

	.code
	mov eax, ebx
	.data
	temp DWORD ?
	.code
	mov temp, eax

Keep in mind, *intermixing `.code` and `.data` directives can cause a program to become hard to read*.

# 3.5 Symbolic Constants

A ***symbolic constant*** is created by associating an identifier with an integer expression or some text. Symbols do not reserve storage; they are used only by the assembler when scanning a program, and they cannot change at runtime.

| | Symbol | Variable |
| :-- | :-: | :-: |
| Uses storage? | No | Yes |
| Value changes at runtime? | No | Yes |

## Equal-Sign Directive

The ***equal-sign directive*** associates a symbol name with an integer expression. The syntax is 

	name = expression

When a program is assembled, all occurrences of *name* are replaced by *expression* during the assembler's preprocessor step.

### Why use Symbols?

Experience has shown that programs are easier to read and maintain if symbols are used. It also allows for easier reassigning of values throughout the whole program.

### Current Location Counter

`$` is called the ***current location counter***. For example, the following declaration declares a variable named `selfPtr` and initializes it with the variable's offset value:

	selfPtr DWORD $

### Keyboard Definitions

Programs often define symbols that identify commonly used numeric keyboard codes. For example, 27 is the ASCII code for the Esc key:

	Esc_key = 27

Later in the program, a statement is more self-describing if it uses the symbol rather than an integer literal.

	mov al, Esc_key    ; good style

### Using the DUP operator

The counter used by `DUP` should be a symbolic constant, to simplify program maintenance.

	array dword COUNT DUP(0)

### Redefinitions

A symbol defined with `=` can be redefined within the same program. For example

	COUNT = 5
	mov al, COUNT    ; al = 5
	COUNT = 10
	mov al, COUNT    ; al = 10
	COUNT = 100
	mov al, COUNT    ; al = 100

## Calculating the Sizes of Arrays and Strings

When using an array, we usually like to know its size. Explicitly stating an array's size can lead to a programming error, particularly if you should later insert or remove array elements. A better declare an array size is to let the assembler calculate its value for you. The `$` ***current location counter*** returns the offset associated with the current program statement.

In the following example, `listSize` is calculated by subtracting the offset of `list` from the current location counter `$`:

	list BYTE 10,20,30,40
	listSize = ($ - list)

`listSize` must follow immediately after `list`, otherwise the value will be too large, because the storage is used by the content between `list` and `listSize` will be added to the value.

The same can be accomplished in calculating the length of a string:

	myString BYTE "This is a long string, containing"
	                 BYTE "any number of characters"
	myStringSize = ($ - myString)

### Arrays of Words and Double Words

When calculating the number of elements in an array containing values other than bytes, you should always divide the total array size by the size of the individual array elements. For example, since a `WORD` is two bytes:

	list WORD 1000h, 2000h, 3000h, 4000h
	listSize = ($ - list) / 2

Similarly, since a `DWORD` is 4 bytes long:

	list DWORD = 10000000h, 20000000h, 30000000h, 40000000h
	listSize = ($ - list) / 4
