This chapter introduces procedures, subroutines, and functions. A ***procedure*** is a block of code with a clearly marked beginning and end, that when called from some other place in a program, returns to its calling point when completed. Any program of reasonable size needs to be divided into parts, and certain parts need to be used more than once. Parameters can be passed in registers, and the CPU uses the runtime stack to track the calling location of procedures. Finally, two code libraries supplied, named Irvine32 and Irvine64, contain useful utilities that simplify input-output.

# 5.1 Stack Operations

A ***stack data structure*** follows the same principle as a stack of plates:
- New data values are added to the top of the stack.
- Existing values are removed from the top of the stack.
Stacks in general are useful structures for a variety of programming applications, and they can easily be implemented using [object-orientated programming methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). A stack is often called a **LIFO structure** (Last-in, First-out) because the last value put into the stack is always the first value taken out.

## Runtime Stack (32-Bit Mode)

The ***runtime stack*** is a memory array managed directly by the CPU, used to keep track of subroutine return addresses, procedure parameters, local variables, and other subroutine-related data.

In 32-bit mode, the ESP register, known as the ***stack pointer***, holds a 32-bit offset into some location on the stack. We rarely manipulate ESP directly; instead, it is indirectly modified by instructions such as `CALL`, `RET`, `PUSH`, and `POP`.

ESP always points to the last value to be added to, or *pushed* on, the top of stack.

Each stack location in this figure contains 32-bits, which is the case when a program is running in 32-bit mode.

### Push Operation

A ***push operation*** decrements the stack pointer (because the stack grows downward) by the appropriate amount according to the instruction operand's size and copies a value into the location in the stack referenced by the stack pointer.

Note that ESP register always points to the last item pushed on the stack.

### Pop Operation

A ***pop operation*** returns a copy of the value in the stack referenced by the stack pointer and increments the stack pointer by the appropriate amount according to the size of the instruction operand.

After the value is popped from the stack, the stack pointer is incremented to point to the next-highest location in the stack.

### Stack Applications

- A stack makes a convenient temporary save area for registers when they are used for more than one purpose. After they are modified, they can be restored to their original values.
- When the `CALL` instruction executes, the CPU saves the current subroutine's return address on the stack.
- When calling a subroutine, you pass input values called **arguments** by pushing them on the stack.
- The stack provides temporary storage for local variables inside subroutines.

## PUSH and POP Instructions

### PUSH Instruction

The `PUSH` instruction first decrements ESP and then copies a source operand into the stack. A 16-bit operand causes ESP to be decremented by 2. A 32-bit operand causes ESP to be decremented by 4.

```
PUSH reg/mem16
PUSH reg/mem32
PUSH imm32
```

*Note*: 8-bit (1 byte) values cannot be pushed onto the stack.

### POP Instruction

The `POP` instruction first copies the contents of the stack element pointed to by ESP into a 16 or 32-bit destination operand, and then increments ESP. If the operand is 16 bits, ESP is incremented by 2; if the operand is 32 bits, ESP is incremented by 4.

```
POP reg/mem16
POP reg/mem32
```

### PUSHFD and POPFD Instructions

The `PUSHFD` instruction pushes the 32-bit EFLAGS registers on the stack and `POPFD` pops the stack into EFLAGS.

```
pushfd
popfd
```

The `MOV` instruction cannot be used to copy the flags to a variable, so `PUSHFD` may be the best way to save the flags. There are times when it is useful to make a backup copy of the flags so you can restore them to their former values later. Often, we enclose a block of code within `PUSHFD` and `POPFD`:

```
pushfd     ; save the flags
...
...
popfd      ; restore the flags
```

A less error-prone way to save and restore the flags is to push them on the stack and immediately pop them into a variable.

```
.data
saveFlags DWORD ?
.code
pushfd          ; push flags on stack
pop saveFlags   ; copy into a variable
```

### PUSHAD, PUSHA, POPAD, and POPA

The `PUSHAD` instruction pushes all of the 32-bit general-purpose registers on the stack in the following order: (1) EAX, (2) ECX, (3) EDX, (4) EBX, (5) ESP \[before executing `PUSHAD`], (6) EBP, (7) ESI, (8) EDI. The `POPAD` instruction pop the same registers off the stack in reverse order.

Similarly, the `PUSHA` instruction pushes the 16-bit general-purpose registers (AX, CX, DX, BX, SP, BP, SI, DI) on the stack in the order listed. The `POPA` instruction pops the same registers in reverse. You should only use `PUSHA` and `POPA` when programming in 16-bit mode.

The following code fragment demonstrates a common pattern in use of these instructions.

```
MySub PROC
	pushad       ; save general-purpose registers
	...
	mov eax, ...
	mov edx, ...
	mov ecx, ...
	...
	popad        ; restore general-pupose registers
	ret
MySub ENDP
```

An important exception to the foregoing example is that procedures returning results in one or more registers should not use `PUSHA` or `PUSHAD`. The call to `POPA` or `POPAD` would overwrite a return value.

# 5.2 Defining and Using Procedures

In assembly language, we typically use the term ***procedure*** to mean the assembly language implementation of a subroutine subroutine. In other languages, subroutines are often called methods or functions.

## PROC Directive

### Defining a Procedure

A procedure is declared using the `PROC` and `ENDP` directives. It must be assigned a valid identifier. When you create a procedure other than your program's startup procedure, end it with a `RET` instruction. `RET` forces the CPU to return to the location from where the procedure was called.

```
sample PROC
	...
	ret
sample ENDP
```

### Labels in Procedures

By default, code labels are visible only within the procedure in which they are declared. It is possible to work around this limitation by declaring a ***global label***, identified by a double colon `::` after its name:

```
GlobalLabel::
```

In terms of program design, it's not good practice to jump or loop outside of the current procedure.

### Documenting Procedures

A good habit to cultivate is adding clear and readable documentation to your programs. The following are suggestions for information you can put at the beginning of each procedure:

- A description of all tasks accomplished by the procedure.
- A list of input parameters and their usage, labeled by a word such as **Receives**. If any input parameters have specific requirements for their input values, list them here.
- A description of any values returned by the procedure, labeled by a word such as **Returns**.
- A list of any special requirements, called ***preconditions***, that must be satisfied before the procedure is called. These can be labeled by the word **Requires**.

Example:

```
;--------------------
SumOf Proc
; Calculates and returns the sum of three 32-bit integers.
; Receives:
;   EAX, EBX, ECX, the three integers. May be signed or unsigned.
; Returns:
;   EAX = sum
;--------------------
	add eax, ebx
	add eax, ecx
	ret
SumOf ENDP
```

## CALL and RET Instructions

The `CALL` instruction calls a procedure by directing the processor to begin execution at a new memory location. The procedure uses a `RET` instruction to begin the processor back to the point in the program where the procedure was called.

## Nested Procedure Calls

A ***nested procedure call*** occurs when a called procedure calls another procedure before the first procedure returns.

![[img16.png]]

Stack structures, in general, are use in situations where programs must retrace their steps in a specific order.

## Passing Register Arguments to Procedures

It's not a good idea to include references to specific variable names inside the procedure. In assembly language, it is common to pass arguments inside general-purpose registers.

For example, to call our simple procedure named **SumOf** that added the integers in the EAX, EBX, and ECX registers, we assign values to EAX, EBX, and ECX:

```
.data?
theSum DWORD ?

.code
main PROC
	mov eax, 10000h
	mov ebx, 20000h
	mov ecx, 30000h
	call SumOf
	mov theSum, eax
```

## Saving and Restoring Registers

When possible, we save and restore registers modified by a procedure so the calling program can be sure that non of its own registers will be overwritten. The exception to this rule pertains to registers used as return values; do *not* push and pop them.

### USES Operator

The `USES` operator, coupled with the `PROC` directive, conveniently lets you list the names of all registers you want to save and restore within a procedure
