[Process Control Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_control_block)

A process control block (PCB), also sometimes called a process descriptor, is a data structure used by a computer operating system to store all the information about a process.

(For our purposes, a pcb. helps us model the concept of global variables.)

To decode something from the code table use:

```unix
./decode.py nameOfThing.py [num of codeTable error]
```

```unix
make turnitin
```
